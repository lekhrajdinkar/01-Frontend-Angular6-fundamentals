## HTTP

### 1. Features:
1. Connecting to service/REST is important :
- to load data from server
- to store data to server
- other task - some calculation which we dont want to do at frontend, etc.

2. two cases:
- send REST > Recive response > Synchronously > it will reload ng SPA > state will be lost/break App.
- send REST > Recive response > Asynchronously > it will NOT reload ng SPA > re-render page with  Data.

3. Add httpModule in rootModule to make it work.

### 2. FireBase Setup
Realtime database - Data As Service

https://console.firebase.google.com/project/ng6-spa-eop/database

https://ng6-spa-eop.firebaseio.com/

"rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": true
}

***

### 3. PROGRAM 

#### 3.1. POST

1. SERVICE => `ServerService.ts` : It will store ServerList in firebase DB.
![img](https://github.com/lekhrajdinkar/NG6/blob/master/notes/assets/http/02.JPG)
- Add Service provider --> AppComponent
- inject http service in our service. hence decorate it with @Injectable.
- `ServerService.ts` > `storeServer()` > `this.http.post()` --> this is just Observable, we are not sending POST request here.

2. Component => ServerComponent

2.1 TEMPLATE
> Create SAVE-SERVER button > on click > onSave() > `this.ServerService.storeServer()` obsrvble

2.2. LOGIC/TS => 

![img](https://github.com/lekhrajdinkar/NG6/blob/master/notes/assets/http/04.JPG)
- Inject the SERVICE into this component.
- Calling service's storeServer(), which is observable. Till this point no REST call made.
- Make REST call (by subscribing) : this is imp step.
![img](https://github.com/lekhrajdinkar/NG6/blob/master/notes/assets/http/05.JPG)
> note : Angular will unsubscribe it once recived response.

```
this.http.post(https://ng6-spa-eop.firebaseio.com/ng-proj-2/servers.json, servers)
```

- FireBase state:

3. Add header in POST req:

- inspect the network > header >

***

#### 3.2. GET
1. Add get functionality in service
![img](https://github.com/lekhrajdinkar/NG6/blob/master/notes/assets/http/10.JPG)
- in service just declare observable, dont subscribe it 

2. component > get button > on click > onGet() method of logic/ts > service > this.srv.getServer() :
![img](https://github.com/lekhrajdinkar/NG6/blob/master/notes/assets/http/11.JPG)
- Subscribe the observable here, becuase we are using it component.
- it will send back JSON object, not JS object.

3. convert JSON into JS object:
![img](https://github.com/lekhrajdinkar/NG6/blob/master/notes/assets/http/12.JPG)
- response is of Response type, import it from http pkg.
- `response.json()`
![img](https://github.com/lekhrajdinkar/NG6/blob/master/notes/assets/http/13.JPG)
- object { 2 array, each have 2 element }
- post called twice here, thats why we got array. `firebase POST` doesnt ovverides exiting data and add new data.
- Could use PUT request to override existing data.

***

#### 3.3. PUT
- same as post, just replace it with this.http.put(...)

***


### 4. Transform response - more effectively

- point 3 of point 3.2 (GET) --> transaforming the repsonse using json(), inside component where its being used. 
- suppose there are 10 more  component, then need to json() or any other type of transformation 10 times - not effective.
- if we centralized the tranformation logic it would be more effective.

- so `this.http.post()` is an observable. `this.http.post().map()` --> here `map` is an operator which will wraps this observable into another observable. And the momemt it is called(subscribed), it will transforms the data/resp.

- `import rxjs/Rs` --> Add this import to use any operator. this package is for Observables.    

- change the `service`
![img](https://github.com/lekhrajdinkar/NG6/blob/master/notes/assets/http/14_1.JPG)

- change the `component` , where it is called/subscribed. now we know we recieve **any[]** type (not **Response** Type)
![img](https://github.com/lekhrajdinkar/NG6/blob/master/notes/assets/http/15_1.JPG)

> so this much better approach, we would have to repeat then transformation logic in multiple places, if we would have not used map() operator.
