## HTTP

### Features:
1. Connecting to service/REST is important :
- to load data from server
- to store data to server
- other task - some calculation which we dont want to do at frontend, etc.

2. two cases:
- send REST > Recive response > Synchronously > it will reload ng SPA > state will be lost/break App.
- send REST > Recive response > Asynchronously > it will NOT reload ng SPA > re-render page with  Data.

### Create Service to make REST call - PROGRAM
1. ServerService.ts : It will store ServerList in firebase DB.

- Add Service provider --> AppComponent
- inject http service in our service. hence decorate it with @Injectable.
- `storeServer()` > `this.http.post` --> this is just Observable, we are not sending POST request here.

2. create SAVE SERVER button > clicked > onSave() > `this.ServerService.storeServer()` obsrvble

- inject the service.
- calling service's storeServer(), which is observable. till this point no REST call made.

- Make REST by subscribing :

> note : Angular will unsubscribe it once recived response.

```
this.http.post(https://ng6-spa-eop.firebaseio.com/ng-proj-2/servers.json, servers)
```
