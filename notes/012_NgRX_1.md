### 1. Older Approach
- services making HTTP call to load data from backend.
- All data was stored on services state.

#### Issue with this approach:
- Difficut to maintain the track of modification of state.
- Application state is distributed among multiple services - no centralized place. difficult to maintain.
- Whenever there is change in service state > it will emits the event with data > all child component will subscribe to event to get new state data. > Additional piece of code would require to send event and subscribe event. > Again difficult to visualize the change.
