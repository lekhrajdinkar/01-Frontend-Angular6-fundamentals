## HTTP - part 2

### 4. Transform response - more effectively

- point 3 of point 3.2 (GET) --> transaforming the repsonse using json(), inside component where its being used. 
- suppose there are 10 more  component, then need to json() or any other type of transformation 10 times - not effective.
- if we centralized the tranformation logic it would be more effective.

- so `this.http.post()` is an observable. `this.http.post().map()` --> here `map` is an operator which will wraps this observable into another observable. And the momemt it is called(subscribed), it will transforms the data/resp.

- `import rxjs/Rs` --> Add this import to use any operator. this package is for Observables.    

- change the `service`

- change the `component` , where it is called/subscribed. now we know we recieve **any[]** type (not **Response** Type)

> so this much better approach, we would have to repeat then transformation logic in multiple places, if we would have not used map() operator.
