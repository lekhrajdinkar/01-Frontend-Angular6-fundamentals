## HTTP - part 2

### 4. Transform response - more effectively

- point 3 of point 3.2 (GET) --> transaforming the repsonse using json(), inside component where its being used. 
- suppose there are 10 more  component, then need to json() or any other type of transformation 10 times - not effective.
- if we centralized the tranformation logic it would be more effective.

- so `this.http.post()` is an observable. `this.http.post().map()` --> here `map` is an operator which will wraps this observable into another observable. And the momemt it is called(subscribed), it will transforms the data/resp.

- `import rxjs/Rs` --> Add this import to use any operator. this package is for Observables.    

- change the `service`

- change the `component` , where it is called/subscribed. now we know we recieve **any[]** type (not **Response** Type)

> so this much better approach, we would have to repeat then transformation logic in multiple places, if we would have not used map() operator. 

### 5. Add more transformation

- eg: Add FETCHED_ before each Server name:
- iterate through each server and do it

- output:

### 5. Effective Error Handling
1. add invalid url in GET request and check error in console.
2. Now Handle it at :
- At `Service` (where observable is defined) : Better place to handle it. More effective, need to handle only once.
- At `component` (where REST is called/subscribed) : or handle it in each component 

3. Add `catch` operator in service:

- this wont work because we need to return observable, `catch` operator does not wrap data into anothor observble like `map` operator does.
- Wrap it with Observable:

**older way:** using  catch operator
```
import 'rxjs/Rx';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs/Observable';

...
...

.catch(
    (error : Response) => {
        return Observable.throw('something Went Wrong');
    }
)
```

**New way:** using pipe operator
```
import { catchError } from 'rxjs/operators';
import { throwError } from 'rxjs';
...
...

.pipe(catchError(error => {
    return throwError(...)
}))
